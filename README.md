# Genetic_NN

Simple neural network that currently runs on a simple implementation of the game
2048. Currently "beats" random, but does so poorly. May revisit in the future to
get better results.

## Building

Requires gcc, and math library. Should be able to just run `make`.  Output file
is `2048`.

## MLOut

5000 Generations worth of data from the genetic neural network.

## RANDOut

5000 "generation" worth of random data.
